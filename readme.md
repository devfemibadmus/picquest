# Pic Quest

Check out app [devfemibadmus/picquestf](https://github.com/devfemibadmus/picquestf) Django admin is cool, but whatâ€™s even cooler is supercharging it to make you feel like the ultimate admin overlordâ€”like, 'Oh yeah, I'm the admin; I can click all the things!' ðŸ˜‚, below are some explanation/code.


## Views

- **Registration/Login**: Handles user signup and login, ensuring unique emails.
- **Data Retrieval**: Retrieves user info and updates authentication tokens.

- **Payment Integration**: Uses Paystack API for secure payments and verifies transactions.
- **Payout Management**: Manages user payouts and referral bonuses.

- **Token Management**: Regularly updates session tokens for enhanced security.
- **Error Handling**: Provides appropriate error responses.

- **Task Retrieval**: Retrieves user-assigned tasks for the current day, including counts of completed tasks and available tasks based on the user's daily limit.  
- **Available Tasks**: Provides a list of tasks not yet assigned to the user, randomly selected up to the remaining limit for the day.


## Admin

- **Document Management**: Administers user-submitted documents, allowing verification and unverification of documents based on provided government and student IDs. Includes custom filters to show deleted files and user verification status.

- **Payout Management**: Handles financial transactions and payouts, including the ability to credit users for referrals and completed tasks. Manages withdrawal cancellations and tracks user balances based on various payout actions.

- **User Task Management**: Oversees tasks assigned to users, with the ability to mark tasks as failed or passed. Updates user task statistics and manages payouts for successfully completed tasks.

- **User Administration**: Manages user accounts and their details, including task counts and payment statuses. Excludes sensitive information from the admin display.

- **Token and Verification Management**: Displays user tokens and verification fees, allowing admins to view verification and payment statuses directly linked to users.

- **Bank List Management**: Administers the list of banks, including tracking usage frequency through custom filters that categorize banks by their usage in payout transactions.


**Filters**

```python
class UsageFilter(SimpleListFilter):
    title = 'Bank Usage'  # Label for the filter in the admin UI
    parameter_name = 'usage'  # Query parameter for the filter

    def lookups(self, request, model_admin):
        # Define options for the filter: Most Used and Least Used
        return [
            ('most_used', 'Most Used'),
            ('least_used', 'Least Used'),
        ]

    def queryset(self, request, queryset):
        # Filter queryset based on the selected usage option
        if self.value() == 'most_used':
            most_used_bank = PayOut.objects.values('bankcode').annotate(usage_count=Count('bankcode')).order_by('-usage_count').first()
            if most_used_bank:
                return queryset.filter(code=most_used_bank['bankcode'])
        elif self.value() == 'least_used':
            least_used_bank = PayOut.objects.values('bankcode').annotate(usage_count=Count('bankcode')).order_by('usage_count').first()
            if least_used_bank:
