            <h2>Earn Rewards for Training Our AI – Your Knowledge Pays Off!</h2>
            <p>At Pic Quest, your expertise is highly valued, and we believe in rewarding you for every contribution. By completing tasks and uploading images, you earn a monetary reward. Each task carries a specific value, starting at $0.7 per task, with your total earnings increasing as you complete more tasks and help train our AI.</p>
            
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Complete Tasks: Each task comes with a fixed reward, which is added to your account balance upon completion.</li>
                <li>Withdraw Earnings: When you're ready to withdraw, head over to the Withdraw page. You'll need to provide your bank details for us to process the request.</li>
                <li>Reward Processing: After you submit a withdrawal request, we may:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Transfer the full amount you earned directly to your bank, OR</li>
                        <li>Offer a reward of equal value, such as gift cards or other exciting prizes, sent to your email.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
